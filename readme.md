🛡️ Agentic AI–Based Home IoT Security System

An Agentic AI–powered cybersecurity system that protects home IoT devices by monitoring traffic, detecting attacks, deploying deception techniques, and responding autonomously — all implemented as a software-only solution.

📌 Problem Statement

Home IoT devices such as smart cameras, bulbs, and routers are often:

Poorly secured

Using default credentials

Not monitored in real time

This makes them easy targets for:

Brute-force attacks

Unauthorized access

Botnet infections

Non-technical users lack tools to detect and respond to such threats automatically.

💡 Proposed Solution

We propose an Agentic AI–Based Home IoT Security System that:

Continuously monitors IoT network activity

Detects suspicious behavior automatically

Uses deception (fake IoT devices / honeypots) to trap attackers

Applies autonomous defense actions without human intervention

Displays real-time security metrics on a web dashboard

🧠 What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to systems that can:

Observe their environment

Decide actions independently

Act autonomously

Learn from outcomes

Our system follows the loop:

Observe → Analyze → Decide → Act → Learn

▶️ How to Run the Project (Localhost)
1️⃣ Create Virtual Environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install flask

3️⃣ Run Backend Components (Open multiple terminals)

Terminal 1 – IoT Device Simulator

python backend/device_simulator.py


Terminal 2 – AI Agent

python backend/ai_agent.py


Terminal 3 – Attacker Simulator

python backend/attacker_simulator.py


Terminal 4 – Web Server

python backend/api.py

4️⃣ Open Dashboard

Open browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

📊 Dashboard Metrics Explained
Metric	Source
Traffic	Generated by simulated IoT devices
Attacks	Generated by attacker simulator
Blocked IPs	Logged by autonomous defense module

All metrics are real-time and dynamic, based on live log data.

🧪 Demo Flow (Hackathon Ready)

Start IoT simulator → traffic increases

Run attacker simulator → attacks increase

AI agent detects attack → blocks IP

Dashboard updates live

🔐 Deception Technique

The system deploys fake IoT devices (honeypots):

Attackers believe they accessed a real device

Real devices remain protected

Attacker behavior is logged

🚀 Future Enhancements

ML-based anomaly detection

Cloud deployment

Mobile app integration

Real IoT hardware support

Advanced attack classification

🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Agentic AI combined with deception and autonomous defense can effectively secure home IoT environments.
It is lightweight, scalable, and suitable for real-world smart home security.
